## Product Description

Our heat exchanger stainless steel square tubes are designed to enhance the efficiency and longevity of your equipment. These tubes are made from premium-grade stainless steel, ensuring corrosion resistance and superior thermal conductivity. They are ideal for use in environments where high temperatures and corrosive conditions are common.

## Material

The heat exchanger stainless steel square tubes are manufactured using 304 and 316L grades of stainless steel. Both grades offer excellent resistance to corrosion and high-temperature stability, making them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.

| Grade | Chemical Composition | Corrosion Resistance | Temperature Range |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 304   | C: ≤0.08, Si: ≤1.00, Mn: ≤2.00, P: ≤0.045, S: ≤0.030, Cr: 18.00-20.00, Ni: 8.00-10.50 | Good | -200°C to 800°C |
| 316L  | C: ≤0.03, Si: ≤1.00, Mn: ≤2.00, P: ≤0.045, S: ≤0.030, Cr: 16.00-18.00, Ni: 10.00-14.00, Mo: 2.00-3.00 | Excellent | -200°C to 800°C |
