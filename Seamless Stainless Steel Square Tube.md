## Material Composition

Our seamless stainless steel square tubes are made from premium-grade stainless steel, typically SS304 or SS316. The material composition is as follows:

- **SS304**:
  - Chromium: 18%
  - Nickel: 8%
  - Manganese: 2%
  - Carbon: ≤0.08%

- **SS316**:
  - Chromium: 16-18%
  - Nickel: 10-14%
  - Molybdenum: 2-3%
  - Carbon: ≤0.08%

The addition of molybdenum in SS316 enhances its corrosion resistance, making it ideal for environments with high chloride content.
