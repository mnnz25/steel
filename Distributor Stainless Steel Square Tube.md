## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316 stainless steel?**
A: The primary difference lies in their chemical composition and corrosion resistance. 316 stainless steel contains molybdenum, which enhances its resistance to chlorides and acids, making it more suitable for harsh environments compared to 304.

**Q: Can you provide custom sizes?**
A: Absolutely! We can accommodate custom sizes and lengths based on your specific requirements. Please contact us for a quote.

**Q: How do I place an order?**
A: You can place an order by calling us at +65 83016969 or sending an email to sales@sd-steel.com. Our friendly customer service team will assist you through the entire process.
