## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between Grade 304 and other grades of stainless steel?**
A: Grade 304 is one of the most commonly used grades of stainless steel due to its excellent resistance to corrosion and heat. It is also easier to form and weld compared to other grades, making it ideal for a wide range of applications.

**Q: Can you provide custom sizes for the square tubes?**
A: Absolutely! We offer custom sizing options to meet your specific project needs. Please contact our sales team for more details.

**Q: How do I maintain the finish of the stainless steel square tubes?**
A: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is usually sufficient. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools that could scratch the surface. For tougher stains, a non-abrasive cleaner can be used.

**Q: Are these square tubes suitable for outdoor use?**
A: While our interior stainless steel square tubes are highly resistant to corrosion, they are primarily designed for indoor use. For outdoor applications, we recommend our specialized weather-resistant stainless steel products.
