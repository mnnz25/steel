## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### Q: What is the difference between 316L and 304 grade stainless steel?
**A:** 316L has higher molybdenum content, which provides better corrosion resistance, especially in chloride environments. 304 is more cost-effective but less resistant to corrosive substances.

### Q: Can I customize the dimensions of the stainless steel sheets?
**A:** Yes, we offer custom cutting services to meet your specific needs. Please contact our sales team for more details.

### Q: How do I ensure proper maintenance of my stainless steel products?
**A:** Regular cleaning with mild detergent and water is sufficient. Avoid exposure to harsh chemicals and abrasive materials.
