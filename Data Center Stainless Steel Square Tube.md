## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 304L stainless steel?**

A: Both 304 and 304L stainless steels are austenitic alloys with similar chemical compositions. However, 304L has a lower carbon content, which makes it more resistant to intergranular corrosion after welding. This makes 304L an ideal choice for applications requiring high corrosion resistance and weldability.

**Q: Can these tubes be customized to specific lengths?**

A: Yes, we offer custom cutting services to meet your specific requirements. Please provide your desired dimensions during the order process.

**Q: How do I maintain the finish of these square tubes?**

A: To maintain the brushed finish, regular cleaning with mild soap and water is recommended. Avoid using abrasive materials that could scratch the surface.
