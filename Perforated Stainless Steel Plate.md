## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316 stainless steel?**
A: Both grades offer excellent corrosion resistance, but 316 stainless steel has higher nickel content and the addition of molybdenum, which provides better resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion in chloride environments.

**Q: Can these plates be customized?**
A: Yes, we can customize the dimensions, hole patterns, and surface finishes according to your specific requirements. Please contact us for custom orders.

**Q: How do I maintain these plates?**
A: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. For tougher stains, use a non-abrasive cleaner and a soft cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive tools that may damage the surface.
