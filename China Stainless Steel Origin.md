### FAQs

**Q1: What are the main differences between SS304 and SS316?**

A1: SS316 contains molybdenum, which provides better corrosion resistance compared to SS304. This makes SS316 ideal for more aggressive environments or applications where higher chemical resistance is required.

**Q2: How do I determine the right thickness for my application?**

A2: The thickness depends on the load-bearing requirements and environmental conditions. Consult with our technical team to ensure you select the appropriate thickness for your project.

**Q3: Can you provide custom sizes and finishes?**

A3: Yes, we can accommodate custom orders. Please contact our sales team to discuss your specific requirements.
