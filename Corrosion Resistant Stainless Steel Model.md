## FAQs

**Q1: What is the difference between 316L and 304 stainless steel?**
A1: 316L stainless steel contains molybdenum, which enhances its corrosion resistance, especially in chloride-rich environments. 304 stainless steel does not contain molybdenum and is generally less resistant to corrosion compared to 316L.

**Q2: Can I customize the dimensions of the stainless steel sheets?**
A2: Yes, we offer customization services to meet specific project requirements. Please contact our sales team at +65 83016969 for more information.

**Q3: How do I maintain the stainless steel model?**
A3: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials to prevent damage to the surface.

**Q4: Is the stainless steel model suitable for outdoor use?**
A4: Absolutely! Our corrosion resistant stainless steel model is designed for both indoor and outdoor applications, providing long-lasting performance even in harsh weather conditions.
