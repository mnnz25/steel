## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What is the difference between grade 304 and grade 316 stainless steel?**
- A1: Grade 304 is the most common type of stainless steel and offers excellent corrosion resistance. Grade 316 provides even better corrosion resistance, particularly in marine environments, due to its higher molybdenum content.

- A2: Yes, we offer customization options for both dimensions and finishes. Please contact us directly to discuss your specific requirements.

**Q3: How do I maintain the appearance of my stainless steel square tube?**
