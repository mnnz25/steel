## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What is the difference between grade 304 and 316 stainless steel?**
A1: Grade 316 has added molybdenum which provides better corrosion resistance, particularly in chloride environments.

**Q2: How do I choose the right thickness for my project?**
A2: Consider the load-bearing requirements and environmental conditions. Thicker materials offer higher strength and durability.

**Q3: Do you provide custom cutting services?**
A3: Yes, we can customize the dimensions according to your project's needs.
