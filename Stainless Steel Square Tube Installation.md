## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What is the difference between AISI 304 and AISI 316?**
**A:** AISI 304 is the most common grade of stainless steel, offering good corrosion resistance. AISI 316, on the other hand, has molybdenum added, which provides even better corrosion resistance, especially in marine environments.
