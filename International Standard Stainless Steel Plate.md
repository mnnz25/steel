## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: What is the difference between 304 and 316 stainless steel?

A1: Both 304 and 316 stainless steel are austenitic grades, but 316 contains molybdenum, which enhances its corrosion resistance, especially in chloride-rich environments. Therefore, 316 is often preferred in marine and chemical processing applications where higher corrosion resistance is required.

### Q2: How do I choose the right thickness for my project?

A2: The choice of thickness depends on the load-bearing requirements and environmental conditions. For instance, thicker plates are typically used in structural applications, while thinner ones may be suitable for decorative purposes or less demanding environments.

### Q3: Can I get custom-sized stainless steel plates?

A3: Absolutely! We offer customization services to meet specific project requirements. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for more details.
