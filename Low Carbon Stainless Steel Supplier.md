## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between low carbon stainless steel and regular stainless steel?**
A: Low carbon stainless steel contains less carbon than regular stainless steel, which enhances its formability and reduces the risk of cracking during welding. This makes it more suitable for applications requiring precise shaping and forming.

**Q: Can you provide custom sizes and shapes?**
A: Yes, we offer customization services to meet your specific needs. Whether you require specific thicknesses, widths, or lengths, our team can tailor the products accordingly.

**Q: How do I place an order?**
A: You can place an order by contacting us directly at +65 83016969 or through our online contact form. Our sales team will guide you through the process and provide all necessary information.
