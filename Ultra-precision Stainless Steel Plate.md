## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between grade 304, 316, and 316L?**

A: Grade 304 is the most common type, offering good corrosion resistance. Grade 316 contains molybdenum, which enhances its resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion. Grade 316L is similar to 316 but with lower carbon content, making it ideal for welding applications without risk of intergranular corrosion.
