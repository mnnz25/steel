## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What is the difference between 304L and 316L grades?**

A1: The primary difference lies in their chemical composition. 304L contains less carbon and more nickel, making it suitable for general corrosion resistance. 316L, on the other hand, has added molybdenum, which enhances its resistance to pitting corrosion caused by chlorides and acids.

**Q2: How do I choose the right size and thickness for my project?**

A2: The size and thickness depend on the specific requirements of your application. For instance, thicker plates are often used in heavy-duty industrial settings, while thinner plates may be preferred for lighter applications. Consult with our technical team to determine the optimal specifications for your needs.

**Q3: Can you provide custom sizes and finishes?**

A3: Absolutely! We offer customization options to meet your exact requirements. Whether you need specific dimensions, surface finishes, or coatings, we can tailor our products accordingly.
