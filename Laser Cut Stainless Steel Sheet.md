## Material

| **Material Type** | **Grade** | **Thickness (mm)** |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Stainless Steel   | 304       | 1.0 - 8.0          |
| Stainless Steel   | 316       | 1.0 - 8.0          |

Stainless steel is renowned for its corrosion resistance, durability, and aesthetic appeal. The 304 grade offers excellent formability and weldability, making it suitable for most general applications. On the other hand, the 316 grade provides superior corrosion resistance and is ideal for harsh environments.

## Specifications

| **Dimension (mm)** | **Width (mm)** | **Length (mm)** | **Tolerance (mm)** |
