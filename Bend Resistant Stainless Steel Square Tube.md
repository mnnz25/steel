### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What is the difference between the material grades 304 and 316?**

A1: The primary difference lies in their chemical compositions and corrosion resistance. Grade 304 has good corrosion resistance but is not as resistant as grade 316, which contains molybdenum and provides enhanced protection against chlorides and other corrosive substances.

**Q2: Can these square tubes be used in outdoor applications?**

A2: Absolutely! Our stainless steel square tubes are highly resistant to weathering and corrosion, making them perfect for outdoor use. They can withstand exposure to sunlight, rain, and other environmental factors without degrading in quality.

**Q3: How do I ensure proper installation of these square tubes?**

A3: Proper installation requires precise measurements and adherence to local building codes. We recommend consulting with a professional engineer or contractor to ensure correct installation and optimal performance.
